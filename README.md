# Cloak

Hide your screen during screen sharing while still being able to see and use your computer normally.

## What is Cloak?

Cloak is a macOS app that creates a shareable window for screen sharing. Instead of sharing your actual screen, you share the Cloak window. When you need privacy, toggle privacy mode and viewers see a placeholder while you continue working normally.

## Features

-   **Privacy Toggle**: Instantly hide your screen with a global hotkey
-   **Multiple Privacy Modes**: Choose between blur pattern, custom image, or black screen
-   **Global Hotkeys**: Work even when Cloak isn't the active app
-   **Fullscreen Support**: Use Cloak in fullscreen for a cleaner look
-   **Hover Controls**: Stop/Privacy buttons appear only when you hover over the window
-   **Self-Hiding**: Cloak window and controls are automatically hidden from the capture
-   **App Exclusion**: Hide specific apps from the shared screen (e.g., Slack, 1Password)

## Download

Download the latest version from the [Releases page](../../releases).

Since Cloak is not signed with an Apple Developer certificate, macOS will block it on first launch:

1. Open **Applications** folder
2. **Right-click** on **Cloak** → Select **Open**
3. Click **Open** in the dialog

You only need to do this once.

Alternatively, run in Terminal:
